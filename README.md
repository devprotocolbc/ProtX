# ProtX

**Protocol X** by **Dev://BC**

## Protocol X for OpenGL

This is the next step in my journey of building a "homemade game engine", now moving from DirectX 11 to OpenGL. The goal remains mainly educational: to deepen my understanding of engine architecture, graphics programming, and C++ development.

### üß† Purpose

**ProtX** is not intended to be a production-ready game engine as a primary goal. Instead, it's a personal playground to:

- Learn modern OpenGL and graphics pipeline concepts
- Experiment with core engine systems (rendering, input, ECS, etc.)
- Strengthen my C++ skills through practical application
- Eventually build my own abstractions over OpenGL

For now I am mainly following a [tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLv8DnRaQOs5-MR-zbP1QUdq5FL0FWqVzg) to get started. Once this is completed the next steps will be taken (e.g. windowing change etc)

### üèóÔ∏è General Design Choices

After starting development on a DirectX-based prototype (**ProtX11**), I decided to switch to OpenGL for better cross-platform support and to learn the differences in API design.

- **Language**: C++20
- **Graphics API**: OpenGL (version TBD ‚Äî likely starting with 3.3+ core profile)
- **Windowing**: Win32 (with the intention to switch out with e.g. GLFW or SDL, planned for 0.1.x)
- **Math**: _Placeholder_ (e.g. GLM or custom math lib)
- **Build System**: CMake
- **IDE**: CLion
